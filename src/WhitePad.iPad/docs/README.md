# WhitePad iPad App Planning Docs

This folder contains the planning documents for a native iPad student client for WhitePad.

Recommended app location:

```text
src/
  WhitePad.Server/
  WhitePad.Web/
  WhitePad.iPad/
    docs/
```

The iPad app should be treated as a first-class client of the existing WhitePad SignalR server, not as a separate product. Its goal is to match the current web student experience while improving iPad-specific launch, Apple Pencil, classroom device management, and reliability.

## Recommended Direction

Build `WhitePad.iPad` as a native SwiftUI iPad app using the existing server contract. Use the same join URL in the teacher QR code for both web and native app launch:

```text
https://<server-host>:5001/join?roomId=<roomId>&token=<joinToken>
```

When the native app is installed, iPadOS should open the app through universal links. When it is not installed, Safari should open the existing web student client. A custom URL scheme can be kept as a fallback, but the QR code should prefer the HTTPS join URL.
